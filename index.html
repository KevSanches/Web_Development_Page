		<p>To learn how to code, you must learn <b>lots</b> of different things, in a lot of different places. Here above, there are some of my favorites.  </p>
		<p>The first one is The Odin Project. Is a site with lots of courses in the web area. It shows you almost anything, from HTML basics to Ruby on Rails. </a></p>
